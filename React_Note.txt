   React Installation:
     Better way -
      1> npx create-react-app myapp
      2> cd myapp
      3> npm start

    > this npx stands for - Node Package Exicute
    > check the current version of React Js 
       npm view react version     

  after installation :
  1> in folder public delete all files neither index.html
  2> delete filesin src folder app.text,logo.svg,web_vital,setup-text.js
  3> remove line number 1 in app.js
  4> remove the contents headerTag to headerTag in app.js
  5> remove 5th and last line in index.js(report_webvitals)
  6> remove all contents in app.css and index.css(we set our own design)
  7> change the app.js to app.jsx


  Basics:
      Component :
            * React app starts with a single root Component.
            * Root Component is build with one or two Component.
            * Each Component can be nested with other component to any leavel.

  common task in front-end development :
           -> app state - data definition,organization and storage
           -> user actions - event handelers respond to user action 
           -> templates - design render Html templete
           -> routing - resolve URLs
           -> data fetching - intract with servers through APIs and AJAX 
    
JSX :
  * jsx stands for javaScript Xml.
  * jsx provides you to write html/xml the processor will transform these expression into actual j.s code 
    eg- <div>Hello world</div>
       Corresponding o.p
         ---------------
       React.createElement(" ");
        Function :
          * Every JSX is converdet to the React.Element function call that the browser understands.
          * type - can be an HTMl tag like h1,div or it can be a REact components
          * props - are the attributes you want the element to have
          * children - contain the other 
          * React.createElement(type)   

        use of JSX :
          *    
        


  Virtual DOM 
  ------------
   -> it is like lightWeight copy of the actual DOM(a virtual representation of the DOM)
   -> it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document
   -> vertual DOM gets updated first instead of real DOM.
   -> when anything new is added to the application, a vertual DOM is created and it is represented as a tree.
   -> whenever there is a change in the state of any element.a new virtual DOM tree is created.
    
    * the process of comparing the current virtual DOM tree with the previous one is known as 'Diffing'
    * the entire prosses of transforming changes to the real dom is called 'Reconcilation'      

  Anatomy of a React component :

   component rendering :
      > when a component function executes we sayit 'renders'
      > assume component may re-render at any time,our job is to ensure taht every time the compont re-render,the correct output is processed

  componts in react :

    * in react everithing is a component
    * 2 types 1,function-based(stateless) 2,class-based(statefull)   
  
  function-based component
  -----------------------
    * stateless component
    * we use hooks to change the component to statfull.

    Hooks :
    > Hooks were introduce in react 16.8.
    > it is use Reacts features-like managing your components state and or performing an after effect when certine changes occurs in state without writing a class.

     state Hook :
      * the React useState Hooks allows us to track state in the function component.
      * state represent the value of a dynamic properties.
      * syntax : const [val,setVal] = useState(100);

        ->adding a state
          1. import {useState} from 'react';
          2. index = 0  , const [index,setIndex] = useState(0)
            then : updating the value of the state :
             function handleCLick(){
              setIndex += 1 ;
             }

     Props 
                Props (short for properties) are a Component's configuration.
                A Component cannot change its props, but it is responsible for putting together the props of its child Components.
                Props do not have to just be data -- callback functions may be passed in as props.

    installation : npm i mdb-react-ui-kit
    import : import 'mdb-react-ui-kit/dist/css/mdb.min.css'; [index.js]


        fontAwsome
       ------------
    1.installation : npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
    import : import "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css"; [index.js]    

      Google fonts
     ------------------- 
   1.google fonts
   2.past to index.css import "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css";


     BootsWatch (for the theme)
    ------------
   1.site : https://bootswatch.com/  
   2.download the bootstrap.min.css file and copy paste into src
   3.import './bootstrap.min.css'; into the index.js  
    

    component creation :
           components :
                  > Header.jsx 
                  > Footer.jsx
                  > AllRest.
                  > jsxViewRest.jsx
                  > RestCard.jsx


    *Backend creation using json server(Details in your ppt)

    *API fetching using axios (Details in your ppt)

    * Routing
    ----------- 

        localhost:3000 -> fetch all the restaurants Details
        localhost:3000/view/id - view particular restaurant details

        The react-router-dom package contains bindings for using React Router in web applications.

        Installation - npm i react-router-dom

        ->BrowserRouter - Use all app routes are Routing (Used to render full application )
        ->Routes -Used for multiple component to route
        ->Route - Used for single component to route
